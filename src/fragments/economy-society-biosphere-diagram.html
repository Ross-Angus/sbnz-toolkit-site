      <p>Intensive food production systems don’t always produce healthy and sustainable food, or quality employment but the metrics used to monitor food production don’t capture these negative outcomes. The ESRC funded project <a href="https://vet.ed.ac.uk/global-agriculture-food-systems/research/projectsbygeographicalfocus/rise/about-rise">‘People and Jobs Nourished per Hectare: Co-production of a new food system metric’</a> included all parts of the food production chain and developed a new agricultural performance indicator that operationalises economic, social , environmental and nutritional dimensions of sustainability. By considering food security, global value chains, employment and social outcomes, the project’s approach to sustainability draws on vulnerability and empowerment, donught economics and just transition approaches to sustainability detailed in the reflect stage below. The project also contributes to SDG 8 good jobs and economic growth, SDG 2 no hunger, SDG 3 good health, SDG 12 sustainable consumption and SDG 13 protect the planet.</p>

      <p>Researchers at <a href="https://www.universities-scotland.ac.uk/cop_hw/">Heriot-Watt University</a> developed a brick made of 90% recycled materials, which produces a tenth of the CO2 emissions and a tenth of the energy of a regular. By reducing harms to the environment, the project also contributes to SDG 12 sustainable consumption and SDG 13 protect the planet. The project’s focus on technological solutions to environmental sustainability challenges aligns it with a green growth approach to sustainability explored in the ‘reflect’ stage below.</p>

      <p>Study of recycling industries documented how <a href="https://www.academia.edu/82928579/Waste_The_first_and_final_frontier">waste is disposed of in affluent communities and industrialised countries</a> and moved to poorer countries, or communities with a low proportion of white residents. Findings highlight the power differentials involved in extracting profit from manufacture processes, the dumping or sacrifice zones they rely on being able to create and provide technologists with the ethical anthropological insights to motivate zero waste or regenerative technologies. By focusing on the role of inequalities in enabling profit making, the project’s approach to sustainability reflects elements of de-growth or vulnerability and empowerment models of sustainability described in the ‘reflect’ stage below. The project’s findings also contribute to SDG 10 reduced inequalities and SDG 11 sustainable cities and communities.</p>

The project highlighted the potential of the internet of things to reduce emissions. By aiming to accelerate the achievement of Net Zero in agri-food, the project’s approach fits a green growth approach to sustainability which we explore in the ‘reflect’ stage below. The authors identified barriers to technology adoption, data needs to maximise the technology’s effectiveness. Findings suggest that AI-enabled solutions show promise and should be deployed in conjunction with other tools and approaches to sustainability. The project also contributes to SDG 3 good health, SDG 12 sustainable consumption and SDG 13 project the planet.</p>

      <p>To examine the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623027221?via%3Dihub#sec5">potential health and climate impacts of different taxes</a> on foods high in fat, sugar and salt, nutritional scientists, geoscientists and agricultural economists in Scotland conducted detailed economic modelling. These foods have environmental impacts and contribute disproportionately to climate change whilst also contributing to preventable diseases. Their findings modelled the trade-offs between environmental, dietary and welfare goals of different policy approaches. The project’s tri-focus on food production within upper planetary boundaries, meeting minimum economic and social needs and its explicit exploration of synergies or trade-offs between them reflects a donught economics approach to sustainability which we explore in the ‘reflect’ stage below. The project also contributes to SDG 10 reduced inequalities and SDG 13 protect the planet.</p>

      <p>UK based researchers analysed existing knowledge on the social, environmental and governance risks associated with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629624002639">mining of critical minerals</a> needed for new low-carbon energy technologies. Their findings identified geography and mineral-specific knowledge gaps and highlighted a pressing need for more data and research on mining governance solutions and ownership models. By highlighting human and environmental impacts of green technologies, the approach draws on environmental justice, just transition and vulnerability and empowerment approaches to sustainability described in the reflect stage below. The project also contributed to SDG 9 innovation and infrastructure and SDG13 protect the planet. Due to the association between minerals and conflict and the strongly gender differentiated impacts of critical mineral mining the project could also potentially provide knowledge to support SDG 5 gender equality and SDG 16 peace and justice.</p>
